# SafeDrive
Sample Integration with ZenDrive

1) Login -> scope -> SafeDriveActivity
   
   Test Access : auto@example.com:qwerty , session@example.com:qwerty , manual@example.com:qwerty

Each of these logins represent the three examples of ZenDrive - AutoTracking / SessionBased Tracking / Trip based Tracking.

Scopes are currently hardcoded and maintained in the code.


2) Zen Integration has been abstracted into module library.
